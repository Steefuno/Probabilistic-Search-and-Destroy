\section{Abstract}
In this project, we demonstrated searching for a cell given probabilities of its location and using prior beliefs while iterating.

\section{Problem 1}
Assume:\begin{itemize}
	\item Belief$[C_{i}]_{t}$ is the belief that the target is in cell $C_{i}$ at time {t}. It is calculated using $P(in(C_{i})|O_{t})$.
	\item $P(F(C_{j}))$ is the probability that the target is not found when searching cell $C_{j}$. 
		It is calculated using $P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))*P(in(C_{j}))+P(!in(C_{j}))$, the probability that the target is 
		not found in $C_{j}$ if the target is in $C_{j}$ added to the probability that the target is not in $C_{j}$.
	\item $P(in(C_{i}))$ is the probability that the target is in cell $C_{i}$, $1/$the number of cells.
	\item $O_{t}$ is Observations at time $t$.
	\item $N_{i,t}$ is the number of times cell $C_{i}$ has been observed and resulted in a failure at time $t$.
	\item Belief$[C_{i}]_{t+1}$, is belief that the target is in cell $C_{i}$ after applying a new observation, that the target is not at $C_{j}$. It is calculated by $P(in(C_{i}|O_{t}\land F(C_{j})$.
\end{itemize}
First, $P(O_{t}\land F(C_{j}|in(C_{i})$ is equivalent to $(P(F(C_{i}|in(C_{i})\wedge N_{i,t+1})+(0\wedge($the number of observations that were not cell $C_{i}))$.\\
\\
Bayes' Theorem can be used to convert Belief$[C_{i}]_{t+1}$ to\\
$P(O_{t}\land F(C_{j}|in(C_{i})*P(in(C_{i}))/P(O_{t}\land F(C_{j})$.\\
\\
Bayes' Theorem can be used to convert Belief$[C_{i}]_{t}$ to\\
$P(O_{t}|in(C_{i})*P(in(C_{i}))/P(O_{t})$.\\
\\
Dividing these the $t+1$ equation by the $t$ equation will give you their multiplicative relationship:\\
$(P(F(C_{i})|in(C_{i}))\wedge (1$ if $C_{j}$ is $C_{i}$, $0$ otherwise$))*(P(O_{t})/P(O_{t}\land F(C_{j})))$\\
\\
So, to update a belief given a new observation:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If the new observation was on this cell, multiply the belief by the probability of finding the target in this cell given that the target is in this cell.
	\item Then, multiply by the previous observations divided by the new observations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Problem 2}
The probability that the target will be found in cell $C_{i}$ given observations is:\\
Belief$[C_{i}]*(1-P($Target not found in Cell$_{i}|$Target is in Cell$_{i}))$
