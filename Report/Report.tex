\section{Abstract}
In this project, we demonstrated searching for a cell given probabilities of its location and using prior beliefs while iterating.

\section{Problem 1}
Assume:\begin{itemize}
	\item Belief$[C_{i}]_{t}$ is the belief that the target is in cell $C_{i}$ at time {t}. It is calculated using $P(in(C_{i})|O_{t})$.
	\item $P(F(C_{j}))$ is the probability that the target is not found when searching cell $C_{j}$. 
		It is calculated using $P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))*P(in(C_{j}))+P(!in(C_{j}))$, the probability that the target is 
		not found in $C_{j}$ if the target is in $C_{j}$ added to the probability that the target is not in $C_{j}$.
	\item $P(in(C_{i}))$ is the probability that the target is in cell $C_{i}$, $1/$the number of cells.
	\item $O_{t}$ is Observations at time $t$.
	\item $N_{i,t}$ is the number of times cell $C_{i}$ has been observed and resulted in a failure at time $t$.
	\item Belief$[C_{i}]_{t+1}$, is belief that the target is in cell $C_{i}$ after applying a new observation, that the target is not at $C_{j}$. It is calculated by $P(in(C_{i})|O_{t}\land F(C_{j}))$.
\end{itemize}
First, for the cell that was just observed as a failure, Belief$[C_{j}]_{t}$ will change to Belief$[C_{j}]_{t+1}$, or $P(in(C_{i})|O_{t+1})$.\\
\\
This can be converted to $P(O_{t+1}|in(C_{j}))*P(in(C_{j}))/P(O_{t+1})$.\\
\\
$P(O_{t+1}|in(C_{j}))$ converts to $P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))^{N_{j}}$ because given that the target is in $C_{j}$, the probabilities of not finding the target in all other cells becomes 1. Then, the probability of not finding the target in $C_{j}$ is $P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))^{N_{j}}$ because the cell is searched $N_{j}$ times and each had $P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))$ to fail.\\
\\
$P(O_{t+1})$ converts to $P(O_{t})*(P(in(C_{j}))*P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))+(1-P(C_{j})))$.\\
$(P(in(C_{j}))*P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))+(1-P(C_{j})))$ is the probability of either failing a search while the target is in $C_{j}$ or of the target not being in $C_{j}$. $P(O_{t})$ is multiplied by this probability to find the overall probability of the previous events AND the new observed event happening.\\
\\
Dividing Belief$[C_{j}]_{t+1}$ by Belief$[C_{j}]_{t}$ will give the multiplicative difference between Belief$[C_{j}]_{t}$ and Belief$[C_{j}]_{t+1}$.\\
This is: $P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))^{1}/(P(in(C_{j}))*P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))+(1-P(C_{j})))$\\
\\
So, multiplying the current belief by $P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))^{1}/(P(in(C_{j}))*P(F(C_{j})|in(C_{j}))+(1-P(C_{j})))$ will update the belief for cell $C_{j}$.\\
\\
This changes the total belief on the map by $\Delta$Belief$[C_{j}]$, so dividing the absolute value of $\Delta$Belief$[C_{j}]$ by the number of cells excluding $C_{j}$ will be the belief all other cells will each increase by.

\section{Problem 2}
The probability that the target will be found in cell $C_{i}$ given observations is:\\
Belief$[C_{i}]*(1-P($Target not found in Cell$_{i}|$Target is in Cell$_{i}))$

\section{Problem 3}
Agent 2 had an average score of 115147.
